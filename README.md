Here in this project we have used Amazon Customer Review data provided by company. The data has two columns- review in text format and label (positive / negative). 
Our objective is to build a classifer model so that it can accurately predict whether a customer's review is positive or negative.
We loaded the data, cleaned the text, tokenized and lemmatized it, then applied TF-IDF for vectorization of the text.
Finally, we split the data into train and test, applied Random Forest Classifier.
